🔑 About the API Key
This project uses a public Roboflow API key embedded in the frontend for convenience and quick prototyping (free-tier usage).

⚠️ Security Notice: The API key is exposed in the source code. This is intentional for demo purposes.

**Please do not abuse it. Be cool.** 😎

For production or private use, consider moving the key to a backend service or securing it with environment variables.
